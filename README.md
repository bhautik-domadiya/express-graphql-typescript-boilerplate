# express-graphql-typescript-boilerplate

A [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) starter kit for building amazing API's in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and with [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) framework.

This repository has a complete GraphQL starter kit written in TypeScript.
This repository has an Example of a TODO app with MongoDB.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Install Node.js
* Official Site [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh)
* on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) and Default [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org)

### Install MongoDB Server
* Official Site [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* on OSX use [homebrew](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
* on Windows use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Set configuration of Mongo-URL in the `src/config.ts`.
* `start:dev` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
* After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app.
* Set configuration of Mongo-URL in the `src/config.ts`.
* Run `npm run start:dev` to start a local server using `nodemon` which will watch for changes and then will restart the sever.
* The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

## Scripts / Commands
### Install
* Install all dependencies with `npm install`

### Running in dev mode
* Run `npm run start:dev` to start nodemon with ts-node, which will serve your app.
* The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

## Exploring the boilerplate

### TypeGraphQL

* Schemas and Resolvers are Created using [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com).
* Schemas and Resolvers example available in `src/graphql/resolvers` , `src/graphql/schemas`

### Structure
```

 |
 |-- package.json                               * what npm uses to manage it's dependencies
 |-- schema.gql                                 * this file was generated by type-graphql
 |-- tsconfig.json                              * typescript config
